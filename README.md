## Download captures from malware-traffic-analysis.net

http://malware-traffic-analysis.net is a great repository of packet captures of malware traffic.

All this does is scan the blog, find all links to pcaps, compares to those you already have in the pcaps folder and downloads the difference.

You can then run it daily to inspect the latest captures quickly.

Thanks to Brad @malwarei_traffic for creating such a cool resource.
